                            warns you that danger is afoot. Imagine
                            you're swimming and suddenly, WOOSH WOOSH!
                            There's a shark swimming around you. You'll 
                            suddenly be really scared: you're full of adrenaline, 
                            your heart is pounding.... maybe you'll even scream.
                            This fear is important as it triggers your instinct 
                            to protect yourself and keep you safe.</p>

                        <p>This kind of fear is sensed when your body 
                            activates the fear response, but there's 
                            actually nothing that can harm you.
                            "When a monster jumps out during a scary movie, 
                            you might experience the exact 
                            same physical response 
                            that the bear in your campsite
                            triggered. The difference is that 
                            while a bear can hurt you, special 
                            effects cannot," says

                Learn the difference between the two types of fear. 
                This can help you to understand that while some situations 
                may seem dangerous to you, they don't actually harm you at
                the end of the day! Scared of initiating a conversation 
                with a (reasonably friendly) stranger? Recognize that this 
                is only a physical fear, and know that you are completely safe.
